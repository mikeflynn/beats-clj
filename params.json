This library does not fully implement the OAuth2 handshake as it is a server-side library. To get a user's authentication token, and instead provides the API actions that accept the authentication token as an parameter.\r\n\r\nI've included [a simple HTML file in the /resources directory](#) that will preform the OAuth2 handshake (once configured with your application credentials) and will output your authentication token. This can be used to get tokens for testing and serve as a reference point for implementation the full OAuth2 interaction in your application.\r\n\r\n*Note: Be sure to update your Beats Application with the OAuth callback url of your test HTML file or you will get an error.*\r\n\r\n## Help\r\n\r\nIf there are any improvements or bugs, please leave an issue on [the GitHub page](https://github.com/mikeflynn/beats-clj), reach out to [@mikeflynn_ on Twitter](http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_) or create a pull request!\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright Â© 2014 Mike Flynn / [@mikeflynn_](http://twitter.com/mikeflynn_)\r\n\r\nDistributed under the Eclipse Public License, the same as Clojure.\r\n","google":"UA-51642712-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
